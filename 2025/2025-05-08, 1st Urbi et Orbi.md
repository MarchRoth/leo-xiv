## May 8th, 2025: 1st Address as Pope

“Peace be with you!” Dearest brothers and sisters, this is the first greeting of the Risen Christ, the Good Shepherd who laid down His life for the flock of God. I too wish that this greeting of peace may enter our hearts and reach your families, all people wherever they may be, every nation, the whole world: peace be with you. This is the peace of the Risen Christ—a peace that is disarmed and disarming, humble and enduring. It comes from God, who loves us all unconditionally.

We still hear the voice—now faint but ever courageous—of Pope Francis blessing Rome. He gave his blessing to the whole world on that Easter morning. Allow me to continue in that same spirit: God loves us. God loves you all. Evil will not prevail. We are all in God’s hands. So, without fear, hand in hand with God and with one another, let us move forward.

We are disciples of Christ. Christ goes before us. The world needs His light. Humanity needs Him as the bridge that leads us to God and His love. Help us—and help one another—to build bridges through dialogue, through encounter, so that we may all be united as one people, always in peace.

Thank you, Pope Francis!

I wish to thank my brother Cardinals who have chosen me to be Peter’s successor and to walk with you as one Church, always seeking peace and justice.

I am a son of Saint Augustine — an Augustinian — who said, “With you I am a Christian, for you I am a bishop.” In this spirit, we walk together toward the homeland God has prepared for us.

To the Church of Rome, a special greeting: Together we must seek how to be a missionary Church — a Church that builds bridges of dialogue, always open to welcome, like this very square, with open arms, all those in need of our charity, our presence, our love. To all of you — brothers and sisters from Rome, from Italy, from all over the world — we want to be a Synodal Church, a Church that walks, that always seeks peace, seeks charity, and remains close especially to those who suffer.

\[In Spanish] And if you allow me a word, a greeting to everyone and especially to my dear Diocese of Chiclayo, Peru, where a faithful people have accompanied their bishop, shared their faith and have given so much, so much to continue to be a faithful Church of Jesus Christ.

\[In Italian] Today, on the day of the Supplication to Our Lady of Pompeii, may our Mother Mary walk with us, remain close to us, and help us with her intercession and love. So let us pray together — for this new mission, for the whole Church, and for peace in the world. And let us ask this special grace from Mary, our Mother.


***Ave Maria…***

**Amen.**
